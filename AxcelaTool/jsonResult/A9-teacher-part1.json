        "good_at": "We had a good session with Rachel around his motivations for work. He was able to clearly share his views and opinions in an articulate way which helped to build discussion and talk at length on the matter. What was interesting were his views around his team, in terms of seeing them learn, grow and develop. he also mentioned about his own feelings around company culture and environment which is important to him in regards to work motivation. He also did well in terms of speaking about the best company to work for. We used De Heus as an example and compared to the market leader CP where he was able to share his views and opinions at length.",
        "need_to_improve": "We spent some time around pronounciation to improve his speech and in particular the \"sh\" sound with use of choice words and sentences to get him practicing. With some sounds there are no issues at all but we regularly spend time on the difficult sayings for Rachel to help him improve. What could be useful is for him to record his own voice and then play back to himself so he can hear where he is making common mistakes and then to take note. We can also work on this together in upcoming sessions."

        "good_at": "Rachel did well today discussing about leadership and qualities to succeed in depth. Regarding leadership he made several suitable points such as strategy, scope and career path when disucssing about being a leader and having a team. We also discussed around qualities such as performance in role and creating added value. With his pronounciation I saw a vast improvement with the \"th\" sound which is good to see.",
        "need_to_improve": "We practiced several sounds today that need help with pronounciation such as \"ed\". With regular practice, Rachel will be able to grasp these sounds correctly and is already showing signs of understanding with a number of words used in examples. The tongue twisters can cause problems at times but that is normal. Today we prcaticed the \"red lorry, yellow lorry\" twister at pace and repeated to test Rachel's skills. This was a useful exercise for him but he will need to practice to see improvements as mentioned."

Using specific examples was able to help his understanding and knowledge and he did well around the whole topic. We also had a short session around the UK and specific sayings and words you are likely to hear from English people which again he was able to pick up well and then provide his own thoughts and feelings that helped him to understand.",
        "need_to_improve": "Prounciation is key for him to focus on. There is improvement with his \"ed\" and \"s\" ending words and he continues to practice with motivation. The tongue twisters are still proving difficult at times and this was coveyed when trying the \"red lorry, yellow lorry\" exercise which requires him to repeat the same words and at speed."
